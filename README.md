#### Project Description

 This application prompts the user to input the name of a burger. Once the user has completed the input process, the burger name is saved to a back-end database AND displayed on the page. The user then has the option to press the eat-button(fork and knive) located next to the name of their burger. If the button is pressed, the burger will switch to the "eaten column" section on the screen and change appearance. The user will then have the option to delete the burger from the screen and database OR keep it displayed in the eaten column on the screen
